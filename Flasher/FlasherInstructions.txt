Creating an EMMC flasher on a uSD card:

1. FAT 16 format the uSD card.
    - Open the command window and enter "diskpart"
    - Select the uSD card as the disk with "select disk#"
    *** Be absolutely sure not to select the hard drive!!!***
    - Enter "clean" after the uSD card is selected
    - Leave the cmd prompt open
    - Create a partition of exactly 4048 MB and format it FAT16
    - Go back to diskpartition, enter "select partition 1"
    - Enter "active"
2. Create a folder "dtbs" using explorer
    - Down load the zip file: "https://s3.amazonaws.com/beagle/beagleboneblack-save-emmc.zip"
    - Upzip the file onto the uSD card.
    - Copy am335x-boneblack.dtb into the dtbs folder
3. Look at the file "autorun.sh". The first section is to backup a BeagleBone Black, and
   the second part is to flash the image that was created in the first part. Edit this file
   for the step you are performing.
