# NOAA BeagleBone Black (BBB) PRU DAQ Cape

<p>The NOAA BeagleBone Black PRU and DAQ Cape was developed for the NOAA Printed Optical Particle 
Spectrometer (POPS) instrument that is used to make balloon and aircraft particle concentration measurements. The 
POPS instrument is patented and can be licensed for $500 per year.  Contact Derek Parks (Derek.Parks@NOAA.gov) for 
more information. This cape and software has been patented and is being presented (with the included disclaimer) 
free for public download, modification and use. The programs that are presented are for the POPS instrument, and are
meant as an example and guide for developing other applications.

Cape Features
-----------------

* A high-speed LVDT serial interface using a DS90C124 deserializer.  It connects via a SATA cable to an 
LT2203 16 bit A/D converter located on the photomultiplier (PMT) interface board, sampling at 4 MHz.
This uses both PRUs to implement, and the data is passed in memory.

* MAX5802 D/A converter providing two 12-bit analog out channels (0-5 V) used for controlling the 
instrument's flow rate and laser power (0-5 V).

* An on-board MS5607-02BA03 pressure/temperature sensor.

* A DS3231 hardware realtime clock and battery holder.

* MAX3223 RS232 interface for two UARTs. UART1 is duplicated in TTL.

* M24256 cape EEPROM.
